  <div class="about-me">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in San Jose, California, and after graduating high school, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the music industry. I attended the Los Angeles Film School and studied Audio Production. After being there for 4 years, and with the tail end of my time there being during the COVID-19 pandemic, I made a tough but necessary decision to change paths in my career and search for one that was more fulfilling. Having a mathematical-based thought process, I soon discovered Epicodus and their Data Engineering course. Lo and behold, I am now beginning my journey to becoming a Data Engineer!</p>
